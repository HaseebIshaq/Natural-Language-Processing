        "Early life and education\n",
        "Matthew Langford Perry was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on August 19, 1969.[1] His mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison (née Langford, born 1948),[2] is a Canadian journalist who was press secretary to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. His father, John Bennett Perry (born 1941), is an American actor and former model.[3][4]\n",
        "Perry's parents separated when he was one year old, and his mother married Canadian broadcast journalist Keith Morrison. He was raised by his mother mostly in Ottawa, Ontario, but he also lived briefly in Toronto and Montreal.[5] Perry attended Rockcliffe Park Public School and Ashbury College, a boarding school in Ottawa.[6][7] He had four younger maternal half-siblings—Caitlin, Emily, Will, and Madeline—as well as a younger paternal half-sister named Maria. His siblings \"would stand and applaud\" him for early performances.[8]\n",
        "By the time he was ten, Perry started misbehaving. He stole money, smoked, let his grades slip, and beat up fellow student and future Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.[7][9] Perry later attributed this to feeling like a family outsider who did not belong when his mother began having children with Morrison, writing \"I was so often on the outside looking in, still that kid up in the clouds on a flight to somewhere else, unaccompanied\".[8] At the age of 14, he began drinking alcohol and was drinking every day by the time he was 18.[10] Perry practiced tennis, often for 10 hours per day,[3] and became a top-ranked junior player in Canada with the possibility of a tennis career. However, at age 15, he moved from Ottawa to live with his father in Los Angeles, where competition was tougher.[3][9][11]\n",
        "At 15 years old, Perry studied acting at Buckley School, a college-preparatory school in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, and graduated in 1987.[12] While in high school, he took improvisational comedy classes at L.A. Connection in Sherman Oaks.[13]\n",

Perry made his film debut in 1988 with A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.[16] In 1989, he had a three-episode arc on Growing Pains, portraying Carol Seaver's boyfriend Sandy, who dies in a drunk driving incident.[17]\n",

After the LAX 2194 pilot fell through, he had the opportunity to read for a part in Six of One and was cast as Chandler Bing. At age 24, he was the youngest member of the main cast.[21] After making the pilot and while waiting for the show to air, Perry spent the summer of 1993 performing at the Williamstown Theater Festival alongside Gwyneth Paltrow.[22]\n",

        "In 2009, Perry was a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, when he presented Ellen DeGeneres with an Xbox 360 video game console and a copy of the game Fallout 3. The gesture led to game studio Obsidian Entertainment casting him in Fallout: New Vegas as the voice of Benny.[42][43]\n",

He played Oscar Madison opposite Thomas Lennon as Felix Unger.[51]\n",
        "Perry played the lead role in the world premiere production of his play The End of Longing, which opened on February 11, 2016, at the Playhouse Theatre in London.[52] Its limited run proved successful despite mixed reviews.[53] Perry restructured the play and appeared alongside Jennifer Morrison in its second off-Broadway production, which opened at the Lucille Lortel Theatre on June 5, 2017. It closed on July 1 after receiving poor reviews.[54] Years later Perry described the play as \"a personal message to the world, an exaggerated form of me as a drunk. I had something important to say to people like me, and to people who love people like me.\"[55]\n",
        "In March 2017, Perry again reprised his role as attorney Mike Kresteva in The Good Fight, a sequel show to the CBS drama The Good Wife.[56] Later that year, he starred as Ted Kennedy in the mini-series The Kennedys: After Camelot.[57][58]\n",

        "In his memoirs, Perry wrote that by age 14, he became an alcoholic.[75] He became addicted to Vicodin after a jet-ski accident in 1997, and completed a 28-day rehab program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation that year.[76] His weight dropped to 128 pounds (58 kg) as he took as many as 55 Vicodin pills per day.[77][78] In May 2000, at the age of 30, he was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with\n",

        "While Perry said in 2002 that although he had made an effort not to drink on the set of Friends, he did arrive with extreme hangovers and sometimes would shake or sweat excessively on set.[3][75] During the later seasons of the series, he was frequently drunk or high on set. His castmates made efforts to help him, even staging an intervention,[75] but were unsuccessful.[3]\n",
        "In February 2001, Perry paused productions of Friends and Serving Sara for two months[3] so that he could enter in-patient rehabilitation for his addictions to Vicodin, methadone, amphetamines, and alcohol.[80] He said later that due to his substance use disorder he had no memory of three years of his work on Friends.[81]\n",
        "In 2018, Perry spent five months in a hospital for a gastrointestinal perforation. During the hospital stay, Perry nearly died after his colon burst from opioid abuse. He spent two weeks in a coma and used a colostomy bag for nine months. Upon being admitted to the hospital, doctors told his family that Perry had a 2% chance of survival. He was connected to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine.[77]\n",
        "Two years later, while attending rehab in Switzerland, Perry faked pain to get a prescription for 1,800 milligrams of Oxycontin per day and was having daily ketamine infusions. He was given propofol in conjunction with a surgery, which stopped his heart for five minutes. The resulting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) resulted in eight broken ribs. He paid $175,000 for a private jet to take him to Los Angeles to get more drugs. When doctors there refused, Perry spent another $175,000 to take a private jet back to Switzerland.[82] In 2022, he estimated that he had spent $9 million on his addiction, including 14 stomach surgeries, 15 stays in rehab, and therapy twice a week for 30 years and had attended approximately 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.[9][83]\n",

        "In July 2011, Perry lobbied the US Congress as a celebrity spokesperson for the National Association of Drug Court Professionals in support of funding for drug courts.[84] He received a Champion of Recovery award in May 2013 from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy for opening Perry House, a rehab center in his former mansion in Malibu.[85] In 2015, Perry sold the mansion and relocated its services.[86] During the COVID-19 pandemic, he launched an apparel line inspired by Friends, with proceeds donated to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 relief fund.[87]\n",

        "On November 3, 2023, Perry's funeral was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles where he was buried.[90] His five Friends co-stars attended, as did his father, mother and stepfather.[91] The Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song \"Don't Give Up\" was played at his funeral. Perry was enamored with the song, and referenced it in signed copies of his autobiography, released in part to help people suffering from depression or addiction issues.[92] Following Perry's death, the National Philanthropic Trust established the \"Matthew Perry Foundation\" to support people suffering from addiction.[93]\n",
        "On December 15, 2023, Perry's death was revealed to have occurred due to \"acute effects of ketamine\".[94][95] Other circumstances that contributed to his death included the effects of buprenorphine, drowning, and coronary artery disease.[94] The LA County medical examiner said in a statement that \"at the high levels of ketamine found in his post-mortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression,\" while \"drowning contributes due to the likelihood of submersion into the pool as he lapsed into unconsciousness; coronary artery disease contributes due to exacerbation of ketamine induced myocardial effects on the heart\". Perry had been receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy sessions to treat anxiety at the time of his death, his last known session of which having been the week prior to his death. However, the report stated \"the ketamine in his system at death could not be from that infusion therapy since ketamine's half-life is 3 to 4 hours, or less\".[96][97][98]\n",
