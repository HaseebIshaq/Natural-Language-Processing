"Subject: Discreet Sale Inquiry

Dear [Redacted],

I hope this message finds you well. Given your interest in rare books, I wanted to discreetly inquire if you might know someone willing to purchase a unique item from our collection. It's a sensitive matter, and discretion is paramount.

Best,
Evelyn"

Evelyn,

I must express my strong opposition to this course of action. Selling any part of the collection, especially in such a manner, goes against everything the library stands for. We need to discuss this further.
